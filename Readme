This project connects a photon to an adafruit neopixel matrix and allows it to be controlled by an html page.  

In this half of the project you will find photos to show the circuit, a video showing how it works, and the code that was uploaded to the particle photon. 
Some caveats: starting a particle photon should happen in a place with a strong wifi connection and without a lot of noise.  
The Hybrid Lab is not a good place to do this, and in fact, it was necessary to bring in a separate wifi source (an ipad) to demo this 
project working in the Hybrid Lab.  Particle has great documentation about how to start up a photon and some good blink examples. 

I used a terminal shell to connect to the photon the first few times and found that really quite helpful, it makes it easier to troubleshoot
bad wifi connections.

Let me know if you have any questions!  caroline.crandall@cca.edu
